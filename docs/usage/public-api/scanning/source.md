## Overview

The sandbox allows you to create scan sources for which you can pre-configure the scan settings.

![Sources](../../../assets/sources.png)

To do this, create a source as shown in the example below and select the appropriate API key for it. In our case - `example-source-token`.

![New Source](../../../assets/new-source.png)

!!! note

    The API key must have at least the `Check with source settings` permission.

Additional details can be found in the sandbox documentation.

## Scan files

```py title="Code example (sync scanning)" hl_lines="16"
import asyncio
from pathlib import Path

from ptsandbox import Sandbox, SandboxKey


async def main():
    key = SandboxKey(
        name="test-key-1",
        key="<TOKEN_FOR_SOURCE>",
        host="10.10.10.10",
    )

    sandbox = Sandbox(key)

    report = await sandbox.source_check_file("./malware.exe") # (1)!
    print(report)

asyncio.run(main())
```

1. By default, a short report is returned. For a full report, add the option `short_report=False`

```py title="Code example (async scanning)" hl_lines="16-19 24"
import asyncio
from pathlib import Path

from ptsandbox import Sandbox, SandboxKey


async def main():
    key = SandboxKey(
        name="test-key-1",
        key="<TOKEN_FOR_SOURCE>",
        host="10.10.10.10",
    )

    sandbox = Sandbox(key)

    task = await sandbox.source_check_file(
        "./malware.elf",
        async_result=True,
    )

    report = await sandbox.wait_for_report(
        response,
        wait_time=100,
        scan_with_sources=True, # (1)!
    )


asyncio.run(main())
```

1. When using asynchronous requests with a source, you **must pass the option `scan_with_sources=True`**, otherwise you will get a 401 error.

                If possible, the name of the uploaded file will be taken as the default value.

                Attention. When using a query with the full result (short_result=false), the response waiting time can be increased by 2 seconds.

                For example, scanning a file without BA takes an average of hundreds of milliseconds,
